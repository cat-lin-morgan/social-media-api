# Social Media API

## Description

This was an experiment in familiarizing myself with the [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/1) way of doing CRUD operations and building out the humble beginnings of a social media website API.

HTTP requests for Users, Friends(User), Thoughts, Reactions(Thoughts).

I tested with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). 

_**Other:** All timestamps have been formatted using the supplied library from Pizza Hunt._

**Packages Used:**

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
